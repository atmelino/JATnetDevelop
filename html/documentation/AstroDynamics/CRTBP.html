	<h1>The Circular Restricted Three Body Problem</h1>

	Trajectories for flights from the Earth to the Moon cannot be solved
	directly, but an approximation that is called the Circular Restricted
	Three Body Problem (CRTBP) can help in finding appropriate
	trajectories. The approximation is such that the spacecraft has
	practically no mass, compared to the earth and the moon, and that the
	orbit of the moon around the earth is close to circular.

	<p>Two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ orbit their common center of mass. A
		spacecraft that has a mass so small that it does not affect
		bodies&nbsp;$m_1$ and $m_2$ gravitationally, but its trajectory is
		determined by the two larger bodies.</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>We choose a reference frame that rotates such that the origin is
		at the center of mass, and bodies&nbsp;$m_1$ and $m_2$ are fixed on
		the x-axis.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Dimensionless coordinates parameter:</p>
	<p>\begin{equation} \mu=\frac{m_1}{m_1+m_2}\end{equation}</p>
	<h4>Equations of Motion (EOM)</h4>
	<p>\begin{equation} f(\mathbf{x})=\begin{bmatrix} \ddot{x}
		\\\ddot{y} \\\ddot{z} \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} x+2 \dot{y}
		-\frac{1-\mu}{r_1^3}(x+\mu)-\frac{\mu}{r_2^3}(x-1+\mu) &nbsp; &nbsp;\\
		y-2\dot{x} -\frac{1-\mu}{r_1^3}y-\frac{\mu}{r_2^3}y \\
		&nbsp;-\frac{1-\mu}{r_1^3}z-\frac{\mu}{r_2^3}z
		\end{bmatrix}\end{equation}</p>
	<p>with</p>
	<p>\begin{equation} r_1= \sqrt{(x+\mu)^2+y^2+z^2} &nbsp; &nbsp;
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \end{equation}</p>
	<div>and</div>
	<div>
		<p>\begin{equation} r_2= \sqrt{(x-1+\mu)^2+y^2+z^2} &nbsp; &nbsp;
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \end{equation}</p>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
	</div>
	<h4>Jacobi Integral C</h4>
	<p>The equations of motion imply that there is a conserved
		quantity. We call this quantity C, and it is called the Jacobi
		integral.</p>
	<p>\begin{equation} C=
		x^2+y^2+2\frac{1-\mu}{r_1}+2\frac{\mu}{r_2}-(\dot{x}^2
		+\dot{y}^2+\dot{z}^2 ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \end{equation}</p>
	<div>It is equivalent to the total energy of a body on a
		ballistic trajectory in an inertial reference frame in a conservative
		force field. For any given location $(x,y,z)$ , the greater the
		velocity $(\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z})$&nbsp;is, the smaller&nbsp;the
		value of C is because of the minus sign in front of the velocity term.</div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<h4>Zero velocity curves and Libration Points</h4>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
	</div>
	<div>In an inertial reference frame and a conservative force
		field, a body has kinetic and potential energy, and the total energy
		which is constant. The potential energy depends on the location only.
		When we throw a rock up in the air, it will stop at one point at which
		all the energy is in the potential energy.</div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>
	<div>Similarly in the CRTBP, there are locations where the
		velocity is zero, and all of the C quantity is contained in the
		location. These locations are either points (five libration points) or
		curves (zero velocity curves) which are closed curves that enclose one
		or two of the bodies (for values of C &gt; C(L5), see below ).&nbsp;</div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<h4 style="font-size: 16px;">Libration Points</h4>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<div>Since we don&#39;t have the values of C for the zero
			velocity points, we can&#39;t use the Jacobi integral equation to
			find these points. We use the EOM&#39;s such that</div>
	</div>
	<p>\begin{equation} f(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{0}\end{equation}</p>
	<div>The first three libration points $L_1$,$ L_2$, and $L_3$ lie
		on the x-axis:</div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>
	<div>
		<p>\begin{equation} y=0, z=0,
			\dot{x}=0,\dot{y}=0,\dot{z}=0&nbsp;\end{equation}</p>
		<div>Only the first EOM gives a non-trivial condition for x. The
			distances reduce to</div>
		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			<p>\begin{equation} r_1= |x+\mu| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				&nbsp; \end{equation}</p>
			<div>and</div>
			<div>
				<p>\begin{equation} r_2=|x-1+\mu| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
					&nbsp; \end{equation}</p>
			</div>
			<div>and the condition for x for $L_1$,$ L_2$, and
				$L_3$&nbsp;is</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
		</div>
		<div>\begin{equation} 0=x
			-\frac{1-\mu}{{|x+\mu|}^3}(x+\mu)-\frac{\mu}{{|x-1+\mu|}^3}(x-1+\mu)
			&nbsp; &nbsp;\end{equation}</div>
	</div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>
	<div>Librations points $L_4$ and $L_5$ lie on the corner of an
		equilateral triangle whose base is the line between the two bodies and
		has the length $l=1$.</div>
	<div>The x-coordinates are in the middle between the two bodies:</div>
	<div>
		<div>\begin{equation} x_{4,5}=&nbsp;-\mu+\frac{1}{2} &nbsp;
			\end{equation}</div>
	</div>
	<div>The y-coordinates are $y_{4,5}=\pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
		$&nbsp;</div>
	<div>So</div>
	<div>
		<div>\begin{equation} L_4= (-\mu+\frac{1}{2},
			&nbsp;\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})&nbsp;\end{equation}</div>
		<div>
			<div>\begin{equation} L_5= (-\mu+\frac{1}{2},
				&nbsp;-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})&nbsp;\end{equation}</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
			<div>Now that we have the coordinates of the libration points,
				we can compute the corrresponding Jacobi energy values $C_1$, $C_2$,
				$C_3$ ,$C_4$, and $C_5$.&nbsp;</div>
			<div>The distances are</div>
			<div>\begin{equation} r_1= |L_1+\mu| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
				&nbsp; &nbsp; \end{equation}</div>
			<div>and</div>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>\begin{equation} r_2=|L_1-1+\mu| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
						&nbsp; \end{equation}</p>
				</div>
				<div>and the energy level of&nbsp;$C_1$ is</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div>\begin{equation} C_1=
					&nbsp;(L_1)^2+2\frac{1-\mu}{r_1}+2\frac{\mu}{r_2}\end{equation}</div>
				<div>&nbsp;</div>
			</div>
			<div>(The equivalent equations for&nbsp;$C_2$, $C_3$ ,$C_4$,
				and $C_5$.)</div>
			<div>&nbsp;</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<h4 style="font-size: 16px;">Zero velocity curves</h4>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>
	<p>We obtain the zero velocity curves by setting a value for C and
		then finding the $(x,y,z)$ which solve the Jacobi equation
		with&nbsp;$(\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z})=(0,0,0)$.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Classes of Orbits and Trajctories</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>On the zero velocity curves, the velocity is zero which means
		that the spacecraft does not move. From here, the spacecraft could go
		both ways by a perturbation: back into the region or away from the
		region. A stability examination would reveal that a perturbation would
		move the spacecraft back into the region. Therefore, the zero-velocity
		curves present an impenetrable boundary for ballistic trajectories.</p>
	<p>
		The energy level $C_{L_1}$ of the $L_1$ libration point is of
		particular interest. If the energy of the spacecraft is below that
		level, then it is caught in an orbit around either $m_1$ or $m_2$. If
		the energy level of the spacecraft is&nbsp;$C_{L_1}$, then the
		spacecraft can barely pass through $L_1$ and transit from an orbit
		around one of the two masses to an orbit around the other. If the
		energy of the spacecraft is above&nbsp;$C_{L_1}$, then the spacecraft
		can pass through points near&nbsp;$L_1$, in addition to $L_1$.
		Therefore, the energy level $C_{L_1}$ represents the <em>minimum</em>
		energy to travel from one body to the other.
