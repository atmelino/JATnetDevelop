	<div class="content clear-block">
		<p>The development process is considered to be in one of three
			stages:</p>
		<p>- The developer is testing features that are under
			consideration for inclusion in JAT or learning how to use some
			features</p>
		<p>- A feature has been selected for inclusion in a future release
			of JAT and is currently made ready for release</p>
		<p>- A feature has been released.</p>
		<p>The subversion repository structure reflects that process:</p>
		<p>
			Code that is used just to test something or to learn a new library,
			but is not yet intended for future release, is kept in the <strong>branches/jatexperimental</strong>
			folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Code that is under development and intended for a future relase is
			kept in the branches under the <strong>branches/jatdevelop</strong>
			folder. When the code is ready for release, it is moved to the
			trunk/jat folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Code that is in the most recent release is in the <strong>trunk/jat</strong>
			folder.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Starting at the root, the subversion repository has the
			following folder structure:</p>
		<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"
			style="width: 500px;">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><pre>
--+-- branches --+
  |              |
  |              +-- jatdevelop    
  |
  +-- tags
  |
  +-- trunk    --+
                 |
                 +-- jat --+-- src
                           |
                           +-- data
                           |
                           +-- dist
                           |
                           +-- lib
                           |
                           +-- zip 
 </pre></td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Data that are used by JAT are stored in the <strong>trunk/jat/data</strong>
			folder. Some of the data files are large, and the separation of code
			and data keeps the core jar files as small as possible.
		</p>
