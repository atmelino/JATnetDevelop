		<h3>Development Cycle</h3>
		<p>the typical development cycle consists of the following steps:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Retrieve the changes from other developers with &quot;<strong>Update</strong>&quot;
				(may delete local files)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>New development:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Edit an existing file</li>
			<li>Check the changed file into the repository by using &quot;<strong>Commit</strong>&quot;
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>or</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Add a new file or folder in Eclipse</li>
			<li>mark the new file or folder for addition to the repository
				with &quot;<strong>Add to Version Control</strong>&quot;
			</li>
			<li>Check the changed file into the repository by using &quot;<strong>Commit</strong>&quot;
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>To find out if there are differences between the local work
			copy and the repository:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>&quot;<strong>Synchronize with Repository</strong>&quot; (No
				changes will be made, neither on the local work copy nor the
				repository)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h2>Problems and Solutions</h2>
		<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
		<h4>1. Refactoring leads to Crash</h4>
		<p>Eclipse is an excellent development environment that allows
			functions such as renaming variables across the entire project, even
			reorganizing the package structure automatically with just one
			command (refactor -&gt; rename).</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, when the project is connected to a subversion
			repository and subclipse is used in Eclipse, then trying to move a
			package into a new folder causes Eclipse to crash, and the change
			cannot be undone other than through checking out the entire
			repository.</p>
		<p>Workarounds:</p>
		<p>(A)</p>
		<p>
			1. <strong>FIRST</strong> manually add every folder and subfolder in
			Eclipse that would be created by refactoring
		</p>
		<p>2. add all of these folders to version control</p>
		<p>
			3. <strong>THEN</strong> refactor
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>(B)</p>
		<p>1. Create the new folders in the working copy with the command
			line and send changes to repository:</p>
		<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1"
			style="width: 500px;">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>
						<p>svn mkdir foofolder</p>
						<p>svn commit</p>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<p>2. Delete the working copy</p>
		<p>3. Delete the project in Eclipse</p>
		<p>4. Checkput a clean new copy</p>
		<p>5. Now refactoring should work, since the folders already exist
			AND are known to Subversion.</p>
